# Procedure for temperature and humidity measurements 
This procedure describes the steps by which you perform a measurement for temperature, humidity with the sht31 sensor via the ARM mbed simulator platform.More specifically, the transmission of data based on the MQTT communication protocol in cooperation with the MQTTBox application where we will be able to see the values we sent.

# Mbed Simulator by ARM

Initially, Mbed is a platform and operating system for internet-connected devices based on 32-bit ARM Cortex-M microcontrollers. Such devices are also known as Internet of Things devices. There are several hardware demonstration boards for the Mbed platform, the first being the original Mbed microcontroller board. The Mbed microcontroller board (marketed as "mbed NXP LPC1768") is a demonstration board based on an NXP microcontroller, which features an ARM Cortex M3 core running at 96 MHz, with 512 KB of flash, 32 KB of RAM, and various interfaces, including Ethernet, USB Device, CAN, SPI, I2C, and other I/O.

# MQTTBox

Developer utility for creating, developing and testing the MQTT connectivity protocol. MQTTBox allows us to create MQTT clients to publish or subscribe to topics, create MQTT virtual devices, test MQTT devices or brokers and much more.
MQTTbox has two formats:
* The add-on in the chrome browser.
* The nodejs App.

MQTTBox is a tool for developers that makes monitoring the MQTT Server a breeze. We can subscribe(subscribe) and publish(publish) topics using MQTTBox, as well as create a virtual MQTT device for testing and debugging. The best part is that we can use the same server for multiple purposes to make the most of our development workflow.
